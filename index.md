Nicolas Rivera

I am a Research Associate at the Department of Computer Science and Technology working with Thomas Sauerwald.

Before that I was a PhD at King's College London under the supervision of Colin Cooper.

My research interest are random processes on graphs, and randomised and distributed algorithms. I am also interested in Data Science and applied probability in general.
