I am a researcher at University of Valpara√≠so in Chile. I am interested in randomised algorithm and stochastic processes on graphs, and applied probability in general.


Here is a list of my publications (you can check my <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=7yULPkgAAAAJ&hl=en"> Google scholar profile</a> as well):
